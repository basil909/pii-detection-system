**SecureScan** is an AI-based solution for detecting and redacting government-issued Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in documents. This tool uses state-of-the-art NLP (powered by [Microsoft DeBERTaV3-Large](https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa)) to identify sensitive data such as Aadhaar numbers, PAN, and passport numbers, ensuring your organization remains compliant with privacy regulations.

## Problem Statement

Organizations handle large volumes of documents that often contain sensitive PII. Manual redaction is tedious and error-prone. SecureScan automates this process by:

- **Detecting PII:** Using a fine-tuned machine learning model to identify sensitive data.
- **Extracting and Redacting:** Automatically redacting PII from documents (PDFs and images) before they are shared or stored.
